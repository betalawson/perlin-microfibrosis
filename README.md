### Perlin Noise for the Creation of Microfibrotic Patterns

## Main Folder
Contains MATLAB code that includes the Perlin noise pattern generator,
as well as the SMC-ABC algorithm used to match to a provided target pattern.

For matching of new patterns, use *matchTargetPattern.m*
If you wish to adjust the pattern generation algorithm, modify *createFibroPattern.m*
or *createFibroPatternNoFibres.m* or *createFibroPattern3D.m*.
